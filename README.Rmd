### Brainstorm ideas

-   palette_discrete()
-   palette_continuous()
-   palette_convert_cb(): convert to color-blind safe palette
-   use the original photo and overlay a 3D heatmap that shows which areas of the image has the highest intensities of colors from the generated palette
-   interaction: showing or saving the hex color code with pointing/clicking (maybe Shiny/plotly)
-   palette optimizer function: given a palette, we make it better
